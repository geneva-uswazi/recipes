5 15.5 oz. cans of red kidney beans (I use the Goya brand)
3 cups very finely ground walnuts
1 bunch finely chopped green onion
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 tablespoon salt (or more, to taste)
1/2 cup liquid from the above-mentioned cans of beans (again, you may want more than this, so don't discard the liquid in the cans)

Combine everything in a large bowl and mix. You will need a food processor for the walnuts, because they need to be crushed up as finely as possible so their oils mix up into everything ... that's where the unique flavor and heartiness comes from. I did bash them with a hammer once with some success, but it's not as fun as it sounds. In the end, you may want to add some salt to taste, and some more bean liquid, which will keep things from tasting dry. Serve cold or room temperature.
